# UnoKeys

UnoKeys is a software to transform your arduino into a macro keyboard, without needing an arduino with hid.

## Installation

Load the arduino code into the arduino you want to use, in this code you can change the number of buttons and the number of pins to your preference, 
then in the config file you must configure the numbers of buttons and the actions you want them to do and put the COM port where the arduino is, and with all that you can run the program.

Every time you change the config file you must restart the program (exit the program in the tray and open the exe again)

## Usage

The config file already has the structure that must be followed for it to work, you can add actions or remove them, as well as the buttons, you can also 
change the speed at which the keys are repeated and the time that must pass for them to begin. repeat (does not apply to buttons with delay actions).
